# Project Overview
An macOS app written in Swift to switch between open application and open new application with the Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut.

# MOST IMPORTANT
Do not over-engineer.
Write the the most efficient code!
Write the simplest possible code!
After writing code, always build and fix all error!

# Build
codebuild -workspace alt-tab-macos.xcworkspace -scheme Debug -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath ./build

# Structure
We minimize reliance on XCode, InterfaceBuilder, Playground, and other GUI tools. You can’t cut the dependency completely though as only XCode can build macOS apps. Currently, the project has these files:

* 1 xib (InterfaceBuilder UI file, describing the menubar items like “Edit” or “Format”)
* `alt-tab-macos.xcodeproj` file describing AltTab itself. It contains some settings for the app
* `alt-tab-macos.xcworkspace` file describing an xcode workspace containing AltTab + cocoapods dependencies. You open that file to open the project in XCode or AppCode
* `Alt-tab-macos.entitlements` and Info.plist which are static files describing some app config for XCode
* `PodFile` and `PodFile.lock` describe dependencies on open-source libraries (e.g. [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle))
* Some `.xcconfig` files in `config/` which contain XCode settings that people typically change using XCode UI, but that I want to be version controlled

The project directory is organized in the following way:

| Path | Role |
|------|-------|
| `config/` | XCode build settings                              |
| `docs/`   | supporting material to document the project       |
| `resources/` | files that are shipped inside the final `.app` (e.g. icons) |
| `scripts/` | bash scripts useful for CI and local workflows |
| `src/`     | Swift source code |
| `src/api-wrappers` | Wrapping some unfriendly APIs (usually C-APIs) |
| `src/logic`        | Business logic (i.e. "models") |
| `src/ui`           | UI code (e.g. sublasses of NSView or NSCollectionView) |

Other folders/files are either tooling or auto-generated (e.g. `Pods/` and `Frameworks/` are generated by `pod install`)
